# Setup

To start the server either build the executable and run the executable

##### Build executable
```bash
go build main.go
./main.go
```

or we could simply run the following code
```bash
go run main.go
```
The service will then be available at `localhost:8000`
To change the above simply change the variable PORT from the .env file

## Implementation

The implementation will be divided into stages focusing on key components, starting with backend services, followed by frontend integration, and finally, the admin portal.




### Database Schema (Summary)
Hereâ€™s a summary of the key database tables involved in the implementation:

1. **Users**:
   - `id`: Unique ID of the user.
   - `username`: Username of the user.
   - `balance`: Current balance available to the user.
   - `transaction_history`: A JSON field to store transaction logs.

2. **Contracts**:
   - `contract_id`: Unique ID of the contract.
   - `commodity`: The commodity or event tied to this contract.
   - `issuer_id`: ID of the user who issued the contract.
   - `amount_issued`: Number of contracts issued by the user.
   - `fraction_pooled`: The amount of each contract pooled by the issuer (e.g., 0.6).
   - `remaining_fraction`: The portion left to be filled by other users (e.g., 0.4).
   - `expiration_date`: Expiry of the contract based on the event's resolution.
   - `status`: Status of the contract (Open, Matched, Expired).

3. **OrderBook**:
   - `order_id`: Unique ID of the order.
   - `contract_id`: Contract associated with this order.
   - `user_id`: User who placed the order.

### Key Features Implemented

- [ ] **User Management**: Registration, login, balance, and simulated fund transfers.
- [ ] **Order Book**: Users can place and cancel orders for contracts.
- [ ] **Real-Time Matching Engine**: Handles partial and full matching of contracts.
- [ ] **Price History Tracking**: Logs matched prices for each event and exposes this data via REST APIs.
- [ ] **Event Management**: Admins create events and resolve outcomes, with user balances updated accordingly.

# Order Book API Documentation

## Overview
This API provides endpoints to interact with an order matching engine. Users can create, modify, and cancel orders, as well as retrieve trade history. The system includes self-trade prevention mechanisms to prevent users from accidentally trading with themselves.

## Self-Trade Prevention
The system implements self-trade prevention to stop users from accidentally trading with themselves. The following modes are available:

- `cancel_newest`: Rejects the incoming order if it would match with an existing order from the same user
- `cancel_oldest`: Cancels existing orders and adds the new one
- `cancel_both`: Cancels both existing and new orders

## Error Responses
All error responses follow this format:
```json
{
    "error": "Error message describing what went wrong"
}
```

## Rate Limiting
Please note that API rate limits may apply. Contact the system administrator for specific limits.

## Example Usage

### Creating a Limit Buy Order
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/order \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

    "order_type": "buy",
    "price": 100,
    "quantity": 10,
    "request_type": "add"
  }'
```

### Cancelling an Order

    "contract_id": "abc123",
    "user_id": "user123",
    "request_type": "delete"
